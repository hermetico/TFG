This repository contains all the relevant code to run the different parts of the project

#### Annotation tool
The folder called Annotation tool contains the application for manual classification. Check the Docs folder and follow the instructoins to get the application working

#### Activity recognition
The folder called Activity recognition contains the notebooks with all the information to test the classifier (use the links below to get the pre-trained models)
It also contains the notebooks, and the datasets in case you want to fine-tune the network from scratch.


#### Pre-trained models
